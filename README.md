### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
 
  - Making [AuRoRA](https://github.com/NERo-AuRoRA/) Open Source and accessible for all researchers in robotics! ([old repo](https://github.com/NERO-UFV/AuRoRA));
  - Competing in Kaggle with [NIAS-IA](https://github.com/NIAS-IA-UFV/);
  - Completing [ForAll](https://github.com/OpenSourceLabUFV/ForAll/tree/kotlin-rewrite)'s first version;
  - Getting the people I work with to shift to Agile/Scrum ðŸ˜†
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

  - Statistical Signal Processing (special thanks to [Colatina](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV0pkAJkePeV1n6bos0phmA/playlists));
  - Data Science in general, specifically;
  - ROS (Robot Operating System)ðŸ˜µ
  - Web fullstack development.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:

  - Open Source dev in general, specially in [OSLU](https://github.com/OpenSourceLabUFV)'s Kotlin [ForAll project](https://github.com/OpenSourceLabUFV/ForAll/tree/kotlin-rewrite);
  - Motion planning in Robotics;
  - Applied Transfer Learning (Computer Vision), DeepRL;
  - Teaching Robotics, targeting research;
  - ANYTHING, really! 

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:

  - Connecting a SICK LMS100 LiDAR to [this ubiquity-xenial-lxde raspberry image](https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html) (v2020-11-07);
  - Ideas for small web projects to get a better grip on fullstack dev (focused on [this architecture](https://github.com/atulmy/fullstack-javascript-architecture)) in my free time;
  - Quit getting involved in so many projects ðŸ˜…
